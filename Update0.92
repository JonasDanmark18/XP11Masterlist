Hello, thanks for coming by this [WIP] post, which contains a variety of different freeware options for X-Plane 11. Hope you found something useful. Also, since I am soon going to University, I don't know how much time I will have to put into it, but I will try and do my best. Thanks for reading :-).

6. Information
A list I’ve compiled, featuring a lot of freeware aircraft, scenery, airports, plugins, etc. for X-Plane 11. The aircraft section is not really organized since there isn't really only 1 creator for some of them, but I think it's okay (hopefully).

1. Aircrafts
 Zibo 737-800 - here
 Probably the most fan-favorite aircraft out here and is essential in your fleet. It contains highly accurate flight models and functions you are not seeing on the default X-Plane 11 737-800.
Ultimate 737-700U - here
Be sure to check out Zibo's Google Drive with newer versions of the 737-700U and 737-900U here.

3. Plugins and scripts

3jFPS - here
This can maybe help you get a little more FPS in the game by disabling or lowering things you may not notice. Use at own precaution.

HeadShake is a must if you want to have the most realism out of your simulator. G-effects and other cool effects that enhance the realism, so it looks like your head is shaking :-).
